feat: Initial release of ATOM Framework v1.5.1

⚛️ ATOM Framework - The Godfather of Full-Stack Development

A revolutionary, compiler-driven, full-stack framework designed for maximum
performance, security, and developer simplicity.

## Core Features

- Zero-overhead development with clean, portable codebase
- Security by obfuscation - core engine compiled into native binary
- Performance by SSR - every page is Server-Side Rendered for SEO and speed
- Isomorphic splitting - write once, runs everywhere (Server + Client)
- Instant hot reload via SSE
- Enhanced image optimization with automatic srcset, WebP/AVIF support
- Streaming SSR for progressive HTML streaming
- ISR/SSG support for Incremental Static Regeneration and Static Site Generation
- Edge runtime compatible (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge)
- Server Actions - zero API boilerplate, call server code directly from client
- Built-in Tailwind CSS with zero-config PostCSS
- TypeScript support with type checking and auto-generated definitions
- Testing utilities with built-in test runner
- Deployment helpers for Vercel, Cloudflare, Docker
- Build analysis with automatic bundle size analysis

## Developer Experience

- Interactive project creation (like Next.js create-next-app)
  - Template selection (Basic, Full-Stack, Empty)
  - TypeScript option
  - Tailwind CSS option (defaults to Yes)
  - ESLint option
  - Automatic dependency installation
- Enhanced DevTools HUD with performance, SEO, and error monitoring
- Error detection system for missing libraries, invalid Tailwind classes, CSS issues
- VS Code integration with syntax highlighting for .atom files
- Automatic port detection (finds next available port if default is in use)

## Technical Highlights
